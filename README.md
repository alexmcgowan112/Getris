This is my first fully fleshed out game so it was mostly intended as a learning experience. It was made using Godot Game Engine.

The concept is inspired by the game Tricky Towers, which I thought would be a relatively simple game to replicate but still fun to make and play.


The game can be played [here](https://alexhasswag112.itch.io/getris):
